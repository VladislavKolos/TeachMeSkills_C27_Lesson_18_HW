Homework for lesson #18

1. **Task #1**

The program creates a collection, fills it with random integer elements, and performs some operations using streams.
Application contains:
- Class **"DecisionLogic"** with private constructor which does not allow creating objects of this class;
- Class **"DecisionLogic"** which contains static void method **"logicImplementations"** which create a collection and fill it with random elements of type **"Integer"**, using **"Stream"**, duplicates are removed, only even elements are displayed, each element is multiplied by 2, the first four elements are sorted, the count of elements and the arithmetic mean of all numbers in the stream;
- Class **"Runner"** which runs the program and calls the method **"logicImplementations"**.

2. **Task #2**

The program creates a collection with the names of all students in the TMS_C27_onl group. 
Application contains:
- Class **"DecisionLogic"** with private constructor which does not allow creating objects of this class;
- Class **"DecisionLogic"** which contains static void method **"logicImplementations"** which create a collection and fill it the names of all students in the TMS_C27 onl group, using **"Stream"**, all values of the collection are converted to lowercase, values starting with "a" are selected, the collection of these values is sorted and the first element of this collection is displayed;
- Class **"Runner"** which runs the program and calls the method **"logicImplementations"**.
